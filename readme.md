Here is my submission for the task provided.

I made a python program using kivy and kivymd package to make an gui plus an app with the help of pycharm and then imported the code in google colab and then exported the app for which i have attached screenshots plus code of both the output in pycharm and the app in mobile. I have also attached the apk file. I could make this project with the use of previous knowledge i had in python packages and how to import and develop an app.
